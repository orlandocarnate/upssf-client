I\u2019m from Bohol where my mother works as a teacher. I have a brother who is in his senior year in high school. My mother and father separated when I was just three and my brother was a week old. We never heard or got any support from my father after he left. We were raised by my grandmother, who is now a retired school teacher. I graduated Valedictorian in Jagna Central Elementary School. For my first two years in high school, I studied in Central Visayan Institute Foundation, also in my town Jagna, where I received a full scholarship for my academic performance. But during my junior year, my mother took me and my brother to Tagbilaran City because she was hired as an elementary teacher in Bohol Wisdom School, our province\u2019s most prestigious school. It was a dilemma for my part that time since I was torn between staying in Jagna and enjoy my scholarship and studying in the city where my tuition would be deducted from my mother\u2019s salary. I chose the latter. My mother assured me that she would make both ends meet just so the three of us could be together. She gave tutorial sessions to augment her meager salary.

I was so happy to hear this and so was my mom when I told her because finally I would have some financial aid besides hers. I really felt happy that I could help her now in the financial matters because I didn't have to ask her for money every time I have some emergency fees to pay.Now that I didn\u2019t have to worry always about money, I gained some weight and improved on my academic work.I became University Scholar for three consecutive semesters starting junior year; an improvement to my two College Scholar achievements during my first two years.")),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"col-md-6"},o.a.createElement("p",null,"During my four years of stay in college, I kept myself busy in school work.Some of my achievements include winning the first place in Komsai.Org\u2019s Codefest 2010, which is a programming contest for all Computer Science students in UPV.But what I pride myself in is the quality of the work that I do.During our junior year, our adviser picked the best students in our batch to be sent to do our OJT in Kabalaka Foundation in Iloilo City.My adviser picked me first and I was assigned to be the leader.The people working at Kabalaka Foundation were impressed at our team because we finished six systems for them in one month.Currently, I am leading a web game development team."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"Besides being busy with school work, I also have something else that always gets me busy.When I was a sophomore, I joined the UPV Hublag Dance Company.I wasn\u2019t really into serious dancing during high school.I knew I could dance but I didn\u2019t really care before.Joining Hublag Dance Company was a result of a self - challenge.I dared myself to do something else besides academics for a change.Back in high school, during the deliberation of honor students for graduation, I was told by my teacher that I was the top student when it came to academics.The only thing that pulled my rank down was my extra - curricular activities.So I guess that frustration also played a part of my joining.I continually improved myself in dancing and eventually our adviser and choreographer trusted me enough to give me dances to choreograph.My family was surprised when they learned that I was in a dance company since I didn\u2019t really show that much inclination in dancing before.This year, I was elected as the dance company president.This exposure to being the org president gave me experience in managing people and leadership.Currently, we are busy preparing for our dance concert on February 22 entitled ICONOPOP which will feature dances from the 4 top icons of all time: Madonna, Beyonce, Celine Dion and Michael Jackson.I have two choreographic works in this concert."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"Now, I\u2019ve been thinking about life after graduation.I am planning to work here in the \xa0Philippines for a few years to gain experience, and when I\u2019m already satisfied and really good at what I do, maybe I can move on to a bigger company where I can share my talent and knowledge to benefit the people.Another option is to take the teaching career path.It runs in our family(my grandmother, mother and four aunts are teachers) and I find joy in helping others understand something better.I was brought up with the value of helping others always instilled in my mind.This I guess is something the UP Silak - Silab Foundation and I have in common: the value of helping others in need."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"On April, I'd soon be graduating and I\u2019m a candidate for graduating with honors (cum laude).
